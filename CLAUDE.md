# Vibecode Workspace

This workspace contains a mobile app and backend server.

<projects>
  webapp/    — React app (port 8000, environment variable VITE_BASE_URL)
  backend/   — Hono API server (port 3000, environment variable VITE_BACKEND_URL)
</projects>

<agents>
  Use subagents for project-specific work:
  - backend-developer: Changes to the backend API
  - webapp-developer: Changes to the webapp frontend

  Each agent reads its project's CLAUDE.md for detailed instructions.
</agents>

<coordination>
  When a feature needs both frontend and backend:
  1. Define Zod schemas for request/response in backend/src/types.ts (shared contracts)
  2. Implement backend route using the schemas
  3. Test backend with cURL (use $BACKEND_URL, never localhost)
  4. Implement frontend, importing schemas from backend/src/types.ts to parse responses
  5. Test the integration

  <shared_types>
    All API contracts live in backend/src/types.ts as Zod schemas.
    Both backend and frontend can import from this file — single source of truth.
  </shared_types>
</coordination>

<skills>
  Shared skills in .claude/skills/:
  - database-auth: Set up Prisma + Better Auth for user accounts and data persistence
  - ai-apis-like-chatgpt: Use this skill when the user asks you to make an app that requires an AI API.

</skills>

<environment>
  System manages git and dev servers. DO NOT manage these.
  The user views the app through Vibecode Mobile App with a webview preview or Vibecode Web App with an iframe preview.
  The user cannot see code or terminal. Do everything for them.
  Write one-off scripts to achieve tasks the user asks for.
  Communicate in an easy to understand manner for non-technical users.
  Be concise and don't talk too much.
</environment>
